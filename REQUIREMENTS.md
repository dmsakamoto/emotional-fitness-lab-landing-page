# EQ & You — Landing Page Requirements

## Project Overview

**What this is:** A landing page for a new brand and business — *Emotional Fitness Lab* — that offers a new category of wellness programming: emotional fitness classes. Think of it like a SoulCycle or Barry's, but for emotional intelligence. These are facilitated group sessions where participants practice EQ skills in real-time — not therapy, not a lecture, but an active, repeatable practice.

**This replaces Inner Pattern Shift entirely.** Marina is sunsetting the IPS brand and relaunching under Emotional Fitness Lab with two offerings:
1. **EQ & You** — the group emotional fitness classes (the primary focus of this landing page)
2. **Personal Coaching** — 1:1 coaching (existing practice, repackaged under the new brand; not the focus of this page)

**Recommended brand name: Emotional Fitness Lab** (over "EQ Fitness Lab" — see Brand section below for rationale)

**Core concept:** Emotional fitness is a new category. Just like physical fitness classes give you a structured workout you couldn't replicate alone, emotional fitness classes give you a structured EQ practice you couldn't do solo. It complements therapy — it doesn't replace it.

---

## Business Context

- Marina developed this format over 15 months of workshops at Clayton Members Club (a private social club in Denver)
- The class now regularly sells out and has a waitlist
- She's validated the format with real demand; now she wants to scale it beyond a single venue
- This landing page is the first step in testing broader market interest

---

## Target Audience (B2B)

This page is NOT aimed at individual class attendees. It targets:

1. **Venue / Studio Partners** — Social clubs, co-working spaces, boutique fitness studios, wellness centers, and similar spaces that program events or classes for their members or communities
2. **Corporate / Workplace Wellness Buyers** — HR leaders, People & Culture teams, L&D directors, office managers looking for wellness programming for employees

**Buyer psychology:** These people are looking for differentiated, high-quality programming that drives engagement, retention, and member/employee satisfaction. They want something fresh that isn't another meditation session or yoga class. They care about: proven demand, professionalism, ease of implementation, and member/employee feedback.

---

## Primary Goal

**Test market interest, collect leads, and serve as a sales tool.**

The page should clearly communicate the concept, establish credibility, and capture email addresses from interested venue operators and corporate buyers. Critically, this page also functions as a **leave-behind for Marina** — something she can send after a conversation, pitch, or networking event to move a prospect from "interested" to "let's talk."

This page is also a tool to help Marina **narrow down her ICP** for B2B buyers. By seeing who responds and from what types of organizations, she can refine her go-to-market strategy.

---

## CTA

**Single CTA: Email signup** — "Get in touch" / "Learn more" / "Bring EQ & You to your space" style. Collect:
- Email (required)
- Name (required)
- Organization / venue name (required)
- Role (optional)
- Type: Venue / Corporate / Other (optional)

Use a simple embedded form (e.g., Tally, Typeform, or a basic custom form). No scheduling tool, no booking flow.

---

## Page Structure (Recommended Sections)

### 1. Hero
- Bold, category-defining headline that names the concept: emotional fitness
- Subheadline that quickly explains the "what" — a facilitated group class for practicing emotional intelligence
- Supporting line with the key differentiator: "Not therapy. Not a lecture. A practice."
- CTA button

### 2. The Problem / Opportunity (for venues & employers)
- Frame the gap: people invest in physical fitness, but there's no equivalent practice for emotional fitness
- Emotional intelligence is the #1 predictor of workplace performance, relationship satisfaction, and well-being — yet there's no gym for it
- For venues: your members want programming that's more meaningful than another happy hour
- For employers: your team needs more than a meditation app

### 3. What Is an Emotional Fitness Class?
- Describe the format in concrete terms so a buyer can picture it
- **2-hour facilitated sessions, groups of 6–24 people**
- Science-backed, led by a trained professional with advanced neuroscience and EQ training
- Each session has a standalone theme — participants can drop in to any session
- Marina has a tested catalog of topics that range widely, for example:
  - "Deep Goal Setting"
  - "Approaching and Being Approachable"
  - "Gratitude and Grievances"
  - "How to Use Emotions as Data"
  - "Self-Talk: Recognizing Negative Self-Talk"
  - "Positivity"
  - ...and many more
- Every topic in the catalog has been tested and refined over 15+ months of live workshops
- Emphasize the breadth: this isn't a one-trick format — it's a full curriculum
- **[PLACEHOLDER — needs Marina's input on what participants actually *do* during a session: pair exercises? group discussion? journaling? somatic work? role play? A 2–3 sentence description of the experience would help buyers picture it]**

### 4. Social Proof / Traction
- Highlight the Clayton origin story (without making it about Clayton specifically — it's proof of concept)
- Key stats:
  - Consistently sells out
  - Running for 15+ months
  - Waitlist demand
  - **[PLACEHOLDER — specific numbers if available: average attendance, number of sessions run, retention rate, waitlist size]**
- Attendee testimonials (2–3 short quotes)
  - **[PLACEHOLDER — Marina will request testimonials from group workshop attendees. Ideal format: 1–2 sentences + first name + context (e.g., "Sarah, Clayton member")]**

### 5. How It Works (for partners)
- Simple 3-step overview of what it looks like to bring EQ & You into a venue or workplace:
  1. **You provide the space and the people** — a room and a group
  2. **We bring the experience** — facilitator, curriculum, materials
  3. **Your community gets a transformational experience** — and keeps coming back
- **[PLACEHOLDER — needs Marina's input on logistics: What does she need from a venue? Does she supply everything? What's the minimum group size? How does pricing work — per session, per series, per head?]**

### 6. About the Facilitator
- Brief bio of Marina — credentials, approach, warmth
- Focus on her unique training blend (neuroscience, attachment, mindfulness — without the full academic CV)
- Photo — **[PLACEHOLDER — needs a new headshot aligned with the Emotional Fitness Lab brand]**
- Frame as: "Created by a coach with advanced neuroscience training who wanted to make deep EQ work accessible to more people"
- **No mention of Inner Pattern Shift** — this is a clean break

### 7. Final CTA
- Repeat the email signup form
- Reinforce urgency/opportunity: "Be one of the first venues to offer emotional fitness"

## Open Questions for Marina

These need answers before the page can be finalized:

### Class Experience (the remaining gap)
- [ ] What do participants actually *do* in a session? (e.g., guided exercises, pair work, group discussion, journaling, somatic/body-based work, role play, reflection?) A 2–3 sentence "here's what it feels like to be in the room" description would be powerful for the page and for pitching buyers.

### Business Model
- [ ] How does pricing work for venues? (flat fee per session? revenue share? per-head?)
- [ ] How does pricing work for corporate? (per workshop? retainer? per employee?)
- [ ] What does Marina need from the partner? (just a room? AV? specific seating setup? whiteboards?)
- [ ] Is this Denver-only for now, or is she open to travel / virtual?
- [ ] Does she want to offer a single trial session, a series, or both?

### Social Proof (numbers)
- [ ] How many total sessions has she run at Clayton?
- [ ] Average attendance per session?
- [ ] How long has the class been selling out / generating a waitlist?
- [ ] Any specific waitlist numbers she's comfortable publishing?

### Testimonials
- [ ] Marina to request 3–5 short testimonials from EQ & You group attendees (not 1:1 coaching clients)
- [ ] Ideal format: 1–2 punchy sentences + first name + optional context

### Assets
- [ ] Headshot for the new brand
- [ ] Any photography or video from Clayton workshops? (even phone photos help establish mood)
- [ ] If starting from scratch: what's the visual direction? (see Design section)

### Brand Decisions
- [ ] Confirm brand name: Emotional Fitness Lab (recommended) vs. EQ Fitness Lab
- [ ] Domain: emotionalfitnesslab.com? eqfitnesslab.com? Check availability
- [ ] Color palette and typography preferences? Or open to exploration?
- [ ] Tone check: Marina's IPS voice is warm, direct, and science-backed — carry this forward, or evolve it?

## Brand Name Recommendation: Emotional Fitness Lab

**Recommended over "EQ Fitness Lab" for these reasons:**

1. **"Emotional Fitness" is the category she's creating.** Putting it in the brand name means she *owns* the language. When someone Googles "emotional fitness," she shows up. "EQ" is insider shorthand that HR people know but venue operators, studio managers, and the general public may not.

2. **Immediate clarity.** A venue partner landing on the page for the first time instantly gets what this is. "EQ Fitness Lab" requires a beat of decoding — "wait, what's EQ again?"

3. **"Lab" is excellent.** It signals experimentation, science, practice, rigor — without being clinical. It positions Marina as someone who's tested and refined this, not someone offering feel-good fluff.

4. **"EQ & You" nests perfectly underneath.** The brand hierarchy becomes:
   - **Emotional Fitness Lab** (the company/brand)
     - **EQ & You** (the group class product)
     - **Personal Coaching** (the 1:1 offering)
   
   "EQ" lives in the product name where it belongs — as a term the audience learns *after* they understand the concept.

5. **SEO advantage.** "Emotional fitness" has meaningful search volume; "EQ fitness" does not.

6. **"EQ Fitness Lab" could be mistaken for a gym** with an EQ angle, which creates unnecessary confusion.

## Design & Technical Direction

### Aesthetic
Based on Marina's existing brand and the Clayton context:
- Clean, modern, warm — not clinical or corporate
- Feels premium but approachable (think: Equinox meets therapy space)
- Muted, earthy tones with a sophisticated palette — avoid neon wellness clichés
- Generous whitespace, high-quality imagery, confident typography
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Tech Stack (for vibe coding)
- Single-page site (no routing needed)
- Static HTML/CSS/JS or a simple React page
- Email form can submit to a third-party service (Tally embed, Formspree, or similar) or a simple serverless function
- Should be easily deployable to Vercel, Netlify, or similar
- No CMS needed at this stage

### Performance & SEO
- Fast-loading, image-optimized
- Basic meta tags and Open Graph for sharing
- Semantic HTML

## Success Metrics

This page succeeds if:
1. A venue operator or HR leader can land on it, immediately understand what emotional fitness classes are, and want to learn more
2. The email form captures qualified leads (not just random signups) — with enough info to identify patterns in who's responding
3. Marina can use the page as a leave-behind when networking or pitching
4. The response data helps Marina narrow her ICP: which buyer type (venue vs. corporate), which industry, and which venue format shows the most interest

---

## Next Steps

1. Marina answers the open questions above
2. Finalize copy and select/create visual assets
3. Build the landing page
4. Deploy and share for feedback
